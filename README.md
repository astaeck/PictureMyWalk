# PictureMyWalk

Small iOS application built with Swift and SwiftUI that tracks a user's walk by requesting the geolocation from the CoreLocation framework and pushes random photos from the surrounding into a list.
The photos are requested from the open source Flickr Photo Search API and the app can run in the background during the user's walk.
